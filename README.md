# Museum of Network Models
A project from my Network Programming class (Fall 2024). 
My team developed a VR project in Unity to depict packet transfer and network architecture. 
Above all, this was a learning experience for using Unity, .NET, and Blender. 

Used https://github.com/ValemVR/VR-Game-Jam-Template as a basis for development.
